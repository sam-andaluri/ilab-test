## Why Did Daqri Shut Down?

Daqri was an AR (augmented reality) startup that shut down operations in 2019 and sold its assets to Snap. The AR startup ran out of money despite managing to raise $275 million from two private equity rounds led by Tarsadia Investments.

The fate of Daqri wasn’t unique. Other extremely well-funded AR startups like Osterhout Design Group and Meta, which raised $73 million from venture capital funds and Tencent, were forced to sell their assets after running out of cash.

There is a view in startup circles that the best innovators can create demand and grow previously nonexistent markets. After all, the innovation and marketing efforts of companies like Microsoft and Apple were the main drivers behind the creation and amazing growth of the PC and smartphone markets. 

Yet, the above mentioned AR startups didn’t manage to achieve the same feat with the AR market despite their access to capital. The AR headset remains a niche technology that hasn’t been widely adopted by consumers.



## Daqri’s History

The company was founded in 2010, and its first product was created in partnership with Crayola to utilize QR codes to create an AR experience on smartphones. It turned coloring pages into interactive 3D objects on the user’s phone.

Daqri also ran a [**Kickstarter campaign**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/daqri/elements-4d-interactive-blocks/posts) to create an educational AR app. However, while marginally successful, the campaign didn’t get a lot of traction and the team realized they were very far away from widespread consumer adoption of AR technology.

Because of this, the company made a pivot and moved its focus on AR tech for enterprise clients.

_The Daqri Smart Helmet used to sell for $15 000. Its main target market was manufacturers._

In 2013, the company was valued at $5 million when it attracted the attention of Tarsadia. The private equity company had made bets in the pharmaceutical space and saw an opportunity in Daqri to invest in nascent tech that would revolutionize the manufacturing workspace.

The company embarked on the ambitious task to produce an AR helmet that was pitched to construction companies, heavy machinery manufacturers, and even the US Navy. To acquire the technological know-how, Daqri went on an acquisition spree and bought multiple startups including [**ARToolworks**](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/13/daqri-acquires-ar-pioneer-artoolworks/), [**1066 Labs**](https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/01/daqri-acquires-1066-labs-to-power-its-augmented-reality-smart-helmet/), [**Melon**](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/40697/daqri-buys-eeg-tracker-melon-to-build-out-augmented-reality-helmet/), and [**Two Trees Photonics**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2016/03/28/augmented-reality-startup-daqri-acquires-hologram-maker-to-take-on-microsoft-hololens/?sh=777e57cc3e5c).

The acquisitions meant that the employees of the business grew in numbers very fast - about 400 people were working for Daqri in multiple offices across the US and Europe. Of course, this meant that the burn rate of the company increased a great deal. By 2017 the cash that flowed from Tarsadia to Daqri amounted to more than $275 million.



## Lack of Product-Market Fit

While the equipment Daqri was building was certainly an impressive piece of tech, it wasn’t clear that the market needed it. The helmet had shiny features like thermal cameras to justify its hefty price tag during a sales pitch, but the workers that were meant to use the equipment weren’t overly enthusiastic about using the technology.

This pushback from the end-users heavily suggested the product didn’t solve any real market need. This is [**the most common reason for startup failure**](https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-mistakes), and the reason why validating your idea and achieving a [**product-market fit**](https://www.failory.com/product-market-fit) is the most important thing for an early-stage startup regardless if you are bootstrapping or if you have $300 million in funding.

Without PMF, it’s almost impossible to achieve sustainable growth regardless of any [**polished marketing videos**](https://vimeo.com/104034319). While these marketing efforts were partly an attempt to jump-start the growth of the AR industry, it’s a virtual certainty that spending a lot of money on promotions is a huge waste before product-market fit.

Former employees argued that the focus on showmanship and selling the vision was done partly for the customers, but also partly for the investor and employees – to help them believe in the future success of the company.

When belief collides with objective reality, however, the latter always wins. In 2018 it became clear the helmet wasn’t generating enough traction and Daqri started laying off employees to reduce costs. The company tried to pivot to simpler AR glasses that sell for $5000. However, the product didn’t manage to win market share over Microsoft’s HoloLens which sold for $3000 and were launched in 2016.

![Daqri Headset](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6114fa6029176915b409b5b5_HBaaHTo-zve7bEjkf40ZtSOyN_yg9ZTjkGVgogsgGRGU1r2LIzrC1pK3yzlaePUBsdpdydPayqNHs9DqA-CboPDHy2AUc7fLI-fAA2PH4hce0ym_GYjWDia7EIuA1RbOX4y454wY.jpeg)

The main revenue driver of Daqri came from Two Trees Photonics, a small UK startup that Daqri had acquired in 2016. Two Trees were building holographic display technologies and selling them to enterprise clients, namely car manufacturers – a product that had PMF, but that served a smaller market. In 2018, the division was spun out into a separate company with the name Envisics.

The AR helmet and glasses, however, continued to generate losses, which forced the startup to wind down operations and eventually sell its remaining assets to Snap for an unconfirmed sum of $34 million. Daqri CTO Daniel Wagner along with two-dozen Daqri employees started working in Snap’s office in Vienna.



## Wrong Incentive Structure

Tarsadia’s investment into Daqri over the years was very atypical for a tech startup. VC funds and angel investors normally acquire a minority stake in a company, which means that the founders (and often early employees) are highly invested in the success of the business by being the major shareholders. This way the interest of the main decision-makers and the investors are aligned.

Tarsadia, however, bought out Daqri. This meant that Daqri’s executive team had already cashed out of the business and wasn’t highly incentivized to fight for its survival. This is a very questionable ownership structure for a startup that still hasn’t managed to become a self-sustaining business and hasn’t found a product-market fit.



## Market Timing

To be fair, however, it’s hard to blame the fate of the project on its leaders or even investors. Tech giants like Microsoft that out-competed startups like Daqri in the space mostly did so because of their deeper pockets.

For example, Magic Leap raised over $3 billion, and both Magic Leap and Microsoft are betting on enterprise clients just like Daqri. Moreover, Magic Leap’s marketing is attempting to sell AR as a whole, not just its products, which suggests that the adoption rates of the technology aren’t as high as they would like. In reality, it’s quite likely that these projects are still burning money.

Ultimately, market timing is crucial, and it’s extremely hard to jump-start a whole new industry. AR and VR might be the future, but this future is not here yet. Before the AR market can grow rapidly, the capabilities of the tech and the needs of the users need to align. For the sake of these extremely ambitious projects, let’s hope that this moment comes sooner rather than later.If you grew up in the 80s or 90s, chances are you’re no stranger to Toys R Us. You might even have the beloved store’s jingle, featuring the slogan “I don't want to grow up, I'm a Toys R Us kid!” stuck in your head.

If you’ve followed the news over the years, you probably also know that Toys R Us has had its fair share of struggles since its golden age, resulting in the closure of all its global retail stores by 2021.

However, it would appear that Toys R Us isn’t ready to bite the dust for good, as it has since made a comeback through a partnership with US retail giant Macy’s. 

Let’s take a closer look at what happened with Toys R Us to better understand the company’s demise and comeback.



## What Was Toys R Us?

Toys R Us was a toy, baby, and clothing retail store founded in 1957 by Charles P. Lazarus in Rockville, Maryland.

![Toys R Us store](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6345c6f81965311438eb7e55_bfWpAu2TIL4GRL5GMy1u6aTo9NAW657O1M9BpnUj-wrG5uD7YIHtIEcgXPlElQwm7e24kt_b3YwdZ4jkR-6tT1HBp9bvg9hTfATOItQ0tH6mQLIAut54i9HUhlRz9LE6iszbvwSA8e6So2aOvtAQ45PiXGstvxl-2p1TGxfFvOmkz6D7hi04F12Naw.webp)

The company’s trademarked name, Toys R Us, is a stylized version of the phrase “toys are us.”

Toys R Us enjoyed much success for many decades as children’s toys and the technology behind them boomed through the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. At its peak, Toys R Us operated 739 US-based stores and 750+ stores in foreign markets.

However, Toys R Us fell on hard times starting around the early 2000s, ultimately leading to the company selling and closing all of its brick-and-mortar stores, which we’ll go into more detail on below.



### A Brief History of Toys R Us

Toys R Us founder Charles Lazarus saw an opportunity to capitalize on the post-war “baby boom” by selling baby furniture and other children’s goods.

In 1948, he founded a baby furniture store called Children's Bargaintown, which he later sold to Interstate Department Stores in 1966.

In 1957, he started a separate company focused solely on toys, thus leading to the founding of the first Toys R Us.

Over the next few decades, Lazarus was able to dominate the toy sales market by negotiating lucrative contracts and selling toys at prices 20% to 50% lower than competitors.

[**By 1978, Toys R Us had 72 stores**](https://www.encyclopedia.com/economics/economics-magazines/toys-r-us) and controlled an impressive five percent of the entire US toy market, resulting in profits of approximately $36 million that year.

In just five more years, from 1978 to 1983, Toys R Us more than doubled its number of stores and market share to 169 stores and 12.5% of the toy sales market. The company also expanded into selling children’s clothing during this time.

By the early 90s, Toys R Us dominated toy sales so much that it forced other popular toy retailers, such as Child World and Lionel, to file for bankruptcy, foreshadowing what would eventually come for Toys R Us itself.

Around this time, Toys R Us was also expanding into international markets, including Japan and Europe. By 1996, the company already had 55 international toy stores. Japan would go on to become its biggest overseas market.

However, the late 90s were also when Toys R Us started experiencing the first big problems, including major competition from other bargain retailers, like Walmart and Kmart, and a serious loss in court to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 

[**The FTC charged Toys R Us**](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2011/03/toys-r-us-pay-13-million-penalty-violating-ftc-order) with leveraging its marketing power to force major toymakers to sell popular toys of the time only to Toys R Us and not to other large retailers, thus blocking them from fair competition and creating a monopoly.

Although Toys R Us would hang on through the ups and downs for another 20+ years, rising competition from internet retail giants, such as Amazon, and massive mounting debt, eventually forced Toys R Us to file for bankruptcy in 2017.

The company ended up selling or liquidating and closing most of its retail stores in foreign markets, including Asia and Europe, in 2018. For example, Irish multinational retailer Smyths bought many Toys R Us stores in Europe and rebranded them.

In the US and Canada, Toys R Us also began liquidation sales in 2018, permanently closing many of its locations that same year. The last two Toys R Us stores in business, in New Jersey and Texas, closed in 2021.



## What Went Wrong With Toys R Us?

As we touched on above, Toys R Us began dealing with a series of struggles, mainly related to market competition, towards the end of the 1990s.

Although many people might wonder if Amazon killed Toys R Us, the first major competition it experienced was from affordable “big box” stores, such as Walmart, Kmart, Target, Costco, and others.

This competition gradually started to eat away at Toys R Us’s sales, and the company began racking up billions of dollars of debt, trying to maintain its stores and operations.

In 2000, Toys R Us partnered with Amazon in a 10-year contract, paying the eCommerce company $50 million a year plus a percentage of their sales to be the exclusive seller of toys and baby products on Amazon.

While this partnership was initially a successful one, it had major implications for the future of Toys R Us — instead of building their own eCommerce business, as they probably should have, Toys R Us was completely reliant on Amazon for online sales.

Amazon learned from its partnership with Toys R Us and eventually branched out and started working with competitors, which further hurt Toys R Us’s market share and online sales at a time when eCommerce was taking off.

If it weren’t for the massive debt Toys R Us had accumulated by the early to mid-2000s, perhaps the company could have kept up with the competition, but so much of their revenue was put into paying off debt that Toys R Us kept declining.

By the beginning of 2005, Toys R Us’s debt was downgraded to junk bond status, meaning that the company was likely to default and was given a low credit rating.

As a result of the lack of revenue available to reinvest in their stores and operations, the shopping experience for customers got worse and stores became understaffed and undermaintained.

By 2017, the toy industry and retail as a whole were on a decline, and Toys R Us couldn’t hang on any longer. The company announced that it was filing for bankruptcy in 2017, citing $5 billion in debt and costs of around $400 million a year just to pay that debt back.

Toys R Us started liquidating, selling, and closing its stores the following year, marking the end of a decades-long reign for the much-loved toy retailer that got its start in the years after World War II.

### What Happened To Toys R Us in Canada?

Toys R Us’s operations in Canada were tied to its US operations and thus equally affected when the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and began liquidating and shutting down in 2018. 

Toys R Us sold its Canadian subsidiary and all related trademarks to Fairfax Financial, a Canadian financial holding company, in June 2018.

Fairfax Financial continues to operate 81 stores under the Toys R Us name across Canada.



### What Happened To Toys R Us in Europe?

Toys R Us began shutting down its European operations, starting in the UK, where it had accumulated £15 million in unpaid taxes.

In March 2018, Toys R Us announced that all its UK branches would be holding liquidation sales and closing within six weeks.

Elsewhere in Europe, stores in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and the Toys R Us HQ in Cologne, were purchased by Smyths and rebranded.

PicWicToys replaced Toys R Us stores in France and was later bought by Smyths.



### What Happened To Toys R Us in Asia?

Toys R Us Asia announced in November of 2018 that it had sold Asian operations of the brand to Fung Retailing, a Hong Kong-based partner that had previously managed most of Toys R Us’s Asian operations.

Fung Retailing continues to operate 470 Toys R Us stores in various Asian markets, including Japan, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, as well as licensed stores in the Philippines and Macau.



### What Happened To Toys R Us in Australia?

Toys R Us shuttered all of its Australian stores by August 2018. However, the brand returned to the country via a partnership with Hobby Warehouse and now has an [**Australian eCommerce website**](https://www.toysrus.com.au/).



## Why Did Toys R Us Shut Down?

Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy and closed all its stores mainly because of rising competition from big box stores and online retailers, billions of dollars in debt, and declining toy sales in general.



### Competition From Big Box Stores and Online Retailers

Big box stores like Walmart, Kmart, Target, and Costco were already well established in the 90s (some were even older than Toys R Us), but these retailers were expanding rapidly towards the end of the decade and began offering lower prices on consumer goods, including toys.

As this happened, popular toymakers, like Hasbro and Mattel, started to sell just as many, if not more, toys through big box stores during this period as they were through Toys R Us.

The proliferation of these other retail giants at the end of the 90s and during the early 2000s was the beginning of the end for Toys R Us, as it gradually lost more and more market share to the brick-and-mortar competition. 

But the nail in the coffin for Toys R Us was the rise of eCommerce toy sales, especially through Amazon.

Toys R Us did attempt to launch its own eCommerce sales via Toysrus.com in 1998, but it ended up being a massive failure, especially after the company failed to deliver gifts on time during the Christmas shopping season of 1999.

This is what led to Toys R Us partnering with Amazon to take over their eCommerce sales for 10 years, starting in 2000, which meant Toys R Us completely abandoned the idea of selling goods via their own website.

Amazon ended up violating the terms of the contract by letting other third-party retailers sell toys on the site, and Toys R Us successfully sued Amazon in 2006 and was awarded a sum of $51 million in damages, which was paid in 2009. 

But this wasn’t enough to stop Amazon — drastically reduced prices and perks like free shipping meant that Amazon’s place at the top of the toy sales market was solidified.

Fast Forward to the holiday season of 2017, and companies including Amazon, Walmart, and Target were selling toys at such discounted rates that it spelled the end of Toys R Us as we knew it.

![US toy retailer market share over time](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6345c74e76b77d03c7de723d_bPl6k1kStU3VBn_rAjZNHai1jOnR1Ld4oJvSwl1oG645H70Fjn2CBOskCaAH0EMVFFAIAC1ImlXTlK8lmW0K1YYGsJVowYjGlGSRpIj4XvC6Qc_8OBBh6nyUFCeQrlODBnPJ03PrDasLR7gYKYacb5Gckj4EhiqROzexUnDr3t49C7WElg5K8AaMdA.webp)

Since these companies could make up for selling toys at a loss through their other merchandise, they could list items at prices that Toys R Us couldn’t compete with. [**Toys R Us stated**](https://www.businessinsider.in/toys-r-us-says-a-perfect-storm-killed-the-toy-chain-and-it-blames-amazon-walmart-and-target/articleshow/63321450.cms) it was “the perfect storm” and began shutting down operations shortly after.



### Billions of Dollars in Debt

As we mentioned earlier, Toys R Us had accumulated around $5 billion in debt by 2017 and had, in fact, already filed for bankruptcy before the “perfect storm” created by competition occurred during the holiday season of 2017.

A big reason behind this debt was that, faced with declining sales and profits, Toys R Us put itself up for sale in 2004, and a leveraged buyout took the company private in 2005.

Investment firms Vornado, KKR, and Bain Capital, bought out the company for $6.6 billion, using billions of dollars of borrowed capital. 

Prior to the buyout, Toys R Us had approximately $1.86 billion in debt. After the buyout, that number shot up to $5 billion (because of the capital borrowed to buy the company).

![Toys R Us debt](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6345c74e06b06b1545b10fc4_DJz6wFO5fDl4jyXHGvTxIVm8K83VexyRCL9gBnKmSrqrRJ7LY2BJ6Wtzx03MC2Kv5PWAS5MbjlLZoeqUOCwErK3z0sLd-UdR404--vUYW3jGORRM1bj1CQNAp0cHjvMdGoYAvssvh2vwMAi81aMUPzgVsi1dLUPG7A6Z5ATfKJ4coqcN4QthkmiF4Q.png)

The addition of more than $3 billion in debt from this leveraged buyout meant the company had very little cash to reinvest into the business.

Customers who continued to shop at Toys R Us stores complained of poor merchandising, lack of employees to help them, and just a general decline in the quality of the shopping experience, so many took their business elsewhere.

The nature of all businesses is that they have to evolve to survive and because of its massive debt, Toys R Us just didn’t have the funding to keep changing and keep up with the modern retail industry.



### Declining Toy Sales

A third, less-mentioned reason for Toys R Us shutting down was a general decline in the sales of toys.

Much of children’s entertainment shifted to digital during the first two decades of the 2000s, and there just wasn’t the same demand for physical toys as there had been up to the end of the 90s.

The toy industry was traditionally heavily reliant on holiday season sales for profits, and more and more parents were giving their children video games and other electronics instead of toys at Christmas.

This trend was reflected in the wider toy sales industry, with many independent toy retailers closing during the same era because business just wasn’t profitable anymore.



## Did Toys R Us Come Back?

So, now you know what happened to Toys R Us and why the company shut down all its stores by 2021, but it's not all over for the beloved toy store. 

Following successful launches in the US and UK, the iconic toy retailer has now announced plans to [**open stores**](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/didn-t-know-it-s-still-in-australia-toys-r-us-stores-to-make-a-comeback-20231110-p5ej0r.html) in Australia in 2024.

After filing for bankruptcy, Toys R Us worked on developing new business models under the name of a new parent company, Tru Kids. 

Tru Kids relaunched the Toys R Us website in 2019 in partnership with major competitor Target as a fulfillment partner. However, the deal fell through, and Tru Kids then partnered with Amazon for fulfillment.

![Toys R Us website](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6345c74f9142ee0d159e8fbd_Bitsg1D5lfoiRKko5ektVm6EqJLVqeS2V80S8Y-1ftr2jolSVlZIDmSXdv9PWQ6YPZqvia6YD8dGJkxS75y1Ew00vn1yAD3Y7odB7d1bC59Gy_we-42jvCQS-iu9hbq5u2fngFJacAoijjPgrKWEuxCSlioRUqmTYVGomTNHvYcIHm9-idhiNX8Usw.webp)

Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, causing more financial losses for Toys R Us, and it was announced in March of 2021 that brand management company WHP Global had acquired the brand.

In August 2021, WHP Global announced a brand partnership with Macy’s, which would allow Toys R Us to sell goods via the Macy’s website and through in-store locations at the approximately 400 brick-and-mortar Macy’s stores.

As of August 2022, Toys R Us had opened locations inside different Macy’s in nine states. The company announced it planned to open in every Macy’s by mid-October, right before the popular holiday shopping season.

Additionally, Toys R Us relaunched eCommerce sales in the UK in September 2022 with a [**new website**](https://www.toysrus.co.uk/) and a catalog of 14,000+ toys available with next-day delivery.

At the peak of its popularity, Toys R Us had a total of 105 retail stores across the UK, where it first opened up shop in 1985. The company has not announced any plans to reopen brick-and-mortar stores in the UK and appears to be fully focusing on online sales for now.

## Wrapping Up

For anyone buying toys in the 80s and 90s, Toys R Us was a household name. 

But, like many other retail businesses, Toys R Us dealt with many challenges related to competition and the changing retail landscape, largely due to the advent of online shopping and digital entertainment.

Despite its massive debt, bankruptcy, and the closure or sale of 1500+ worldwide retail stores, Toys R Us is still around.

Those who love the nostalgia of the Toys R Us brand will be happy to know it can now be found inside Macy’s stores throughout the US, as well as online in the US, the UK, and other international markets.Short-form video app and social media platform Musical.ly lived a relatively short life, from its launch in 2014 to its acquisition in 2017 and eventual shutdown in 2018.

Despite its short lifespan, Musical.ly accumulated more than 200 million users during its active years and received millions of video uploads each day, leading many people to wonder what exactly happened to Musical.ly and ask why it shut down if it was so popular.

The short answer is that it was folded into TikTok, which is currently the world’s most popular video-sharing app.

But an app doesn’t just go from an idea to getting acquired and merged with TikTok overnight, so let’s take a look at the origins of Musical.ly and see how it reached its eventual end.



## What Was Musical.ly?

Officially launched in August of 2014, Musical.ly was a video-based social media platform that allowed users to share and view short video clips from 15 seconds to one minute long.

Users could select from different songs to add as soundtracks to their videos, and the app helped give rise to the popular lip-sync video trend.

![Musical.ly](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/635948cb6d28650f2082c7d8__KPkHXSkkvpIyDqJKAZvlUuGw2hl52I28semdTkA_yQkDg1L5IbLvjUZfLuVi4FZ59TGi9TAK8L_47rFK8X7rPnNPCcIYGnB2wfxmZzOt_iZuTfT6jCHYGzrMPW5t4ck3rTUKAmAKwaQ1KnZT2wguphyr2FuhjGtqVBTlPCUiO9mAOiyqvap2Ab6Jw.webp)

Like other popular social media platforms, Musical.ly’s millions of users could follow different accounts, like, comment on, and share other users’ content.

Musical.ly was headquartered in Shanghai, China, but gained a large following internationally, especially in the US. It was particularly popular with pre-teen and teenage girls.

Musical.ly was eventually acquired by TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, on November 9, 2017, for a whopping sum of between [**$800 million and $1 billion**](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/10/musical-ly-app-sells-for-1-billion.html). 

ByteDance originally stated that Musical.ly would continue to operate as an independent app. However, they shut Musical.ly down not long after the acquisition, in August of 2018 — we’ll go into more detail on Musical.ly getting shut down below.

But before we take a closer look at what happened to Musical.ly, let’s back up and see who founded Musical.ly and how the platform got its start to better understand why it eventually got acquired and shut down.



## The Musical.ly Story

Musical.ly was founded by [**Alex Zhu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keepsilence/) and [**Luyu Yang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luyu-yang-726272b/), a pair of Chinese entrepreneurs who met at eBaoTech, a digital solutions provider for the global insurance industry.

Zhu had graduated from China’s Zhejiang University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering, and worked in various tech industry jobs in China and the US before joining eBaoTech and linking up with his co-founder Yang.

Zhu’s original startup idea was for a different short-form video app called Cicada, which was intended for sharing educational video content.

Zhu and Yang were initially able to raise $250,000 from Hong Kong-based VC firm ChinaRock Capital Management to start working on their idea. But the idea for Cicada had some problems, specifically with the way users had to create videos, and it never took off.

So, as many co-founders do, Zhu and Yang pivoted from their original idea and came up with a new idea for a video-based app that combined music, video, and social media. 

At this point, Musical.ly’s creators had less than 10% of their seed funding left, and they created the first version of Musical.ly in just 30 days, unofficially releasing their MVP in July of 2014. The official version launched the following month.

Even though its co-founders created the app in China, they always had their sights set on the US market, mainly because Zhu believed that Chinese teens were too busy to focus on social media apps and didn’t have the same internet browsing culture as US teens did.

With the limited funding they had left, Zhu and Yang had to make some crucial decisions about Musical.ly’s direction to try and succeed early on.

One decision that turned out to be the right one was to focus on lip-syncing content, which was particularly popular due to the TV show Lip Sync Battle that premiered shortly after Musical.ly launched. 

After the co-founders made a few tweaks to the functionality of their app and pivoted towards emphasizing its lip-syncing features, Musical.ly started experiencing exponential growth.

By the summer of 2015, about a year after launching, Musical.ly was in the number one spot in the App Store, and Musical.ly’s founders were rewarded with another $16.6 million in funding from venture capitalists.

With the new injection of funding and continued organic growth, Musical.ly reached 40+ million users by the end of 2015.

In May of the following year, less than two years after the app’s launch, Musical.ly raised another $133.5 million in funding and was valued at an impressive $550 million.

At the end of 2016, Musical.ly had more than tripled its number of users to approximately 130 million, of which there were 40 million monthly active users.

By this time, Musical.ly had already launched a second app called live.ly, which was a spinoff of Musical.ly for streaming live videos. 

The company launched a third app in early 2017, called Ping Pong, for group video chatting.

Another thing that happened in early 2017 was that Musical.ly partnered with Apple Music on its music catalog. 

Around the same time, the Musical.ly team also decided to stop focusing on only lip sync content and shift to being an app for all types of videos. 

To support this pivot, Musical.ly partnered with several major broadcasting networks, including Hearst and Viacom, to release original content on the platform.

In August 2017, Musical.ly received a significant redesign with a new emphasis on feed personalization and customization. 

However, a few months later, the company announced that it had been sold to TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance. 

ByteDance did not shut down Musical.ly right away, and the app continued to function as normal until August of 2018, when ByteDance suddenly announced that it would be merging Musical.ly into TikTok, thus ending its four-year run.



## How Did Musical.ly Work?

Musical.ly was available on Android and iOS and allowed users to record videos from 15 seconds to one minute long, in one or multiple shots. They could add soundtracks using songs or other background tracks, such as comedic sound effects.

From early on, Musical.ly’s emphasis was on lip-syncing, and users could choose from thousands of songs to set their recordings to. 

This was due to Musical.ly partnering with major record labels, such as Warner Music Group, to allow their music to be licensed for use on the Musical.ly platform.

When Musical.ly partnered with Apple Music in 2017, users could cut 15-second clips from songs streamed via Apple Music and use them for their Musical.ly videos.

![Musical.ly's partnership with Apple Music](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/635948cb4109b0ef74003ce5_zqCc3d-ktKoCpXYAJ_ZDKCn5iV3DGeLr1BCfEOpVEOPf2DV5hRH5CxLEzqqwQXWGXbC33wE-BLBypmUKkY0A0Yme4KxPI8WF4jsKLNl6RbfWOnE-uUMe47GmQ1_JWAeqmB2ToeYVhgH65J7g3cZeVVydEWQGpR5elxPW5mbiY3mbA_Z-DI6OB-z-3A.webp)

Other features of Musical.ly included adding pre-set filters to videos, changing the speed of videos, and reversing the recording motion, among other standard editing features.

Musical.ly also focused mainly on the user experience regarding what videos they saw on their feeds. The app featured various video categories, trending videos, song charts, and leaderboards that showed what soundtracks were most popular at any given time.

Users could also share their videos across other social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. 

All videos created using Musical.ly had a watermark of the company’s logo in them, which was one of the brand’s early marketing strategies that helped them grow through cross-exposure on more popular social platforms.

Interestingly, users were cropping out the Musical.ly watermark when they cross-shared videos early on, which caused the Musical.ly team to change the position of the watermark. This seemingly small decision likely had a significant impact on the brand’s early exposure.

Musical.ly was the preferred platform of many social video content influencers, and the company manually verified popular users and awarded their profiles with crowns to show they had been verified. 

Some extremely popular TikTok content creators, such as Ariel Martin and Loren Gray, got their start on Musical.ly. 

These influencers gained the followings of millions on Musical.ly for their lip-syncing videos and even garnered media attention, landing interviews on shows such as Good Morning America.

When Musical.ly merged with TikTok, many of its features were incorporated or reworked into TikTok. They also provided performance analytics to users to help former Musical.ly influencers continue to succeed on TikTok.



## What Happened To Musical.ly?

As we mentioned earlier, Musical.ly was merged into TikTok about a year after it was acquired by ByteDance.

According to a representative of ByteDance, these were the original plans for Musical.ly:

_“Musical.ly will continue to operate as an independent platform, integrating ByteDance’s global leading \[artificial intelligence\] technology and leveraging its reach in China and key markets across Asia to enhance Musical.ly’s offering to users, creators, and partners.”_

However, ByteDance ultimately decided that it made the most sense to consolidate Musical.ly and TikTok users into a single app, so they chose to be TikTok.

All of Musical.ly’s users and content were migrated over to TikTok, making the sudden closure of Musical.ly and its merging into TikTok a smooth transition.

TikTok also incorporated some of Musical.ly’s popular features into the new and improved app, including a feed that showed users personalized content based on their viewing preferences and history.

Musical.ly's content and users smoothly transitioned to TikTok, retaining features like a personalized content feed. Despite some influencers' criticism over the abrupt change, TikTok's popularity soared, becoming the U.S.'s top app in 2018 and amassing over 750 million monthly active users globally.

![TikTok's user growth](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/635948cb2f19185ec8873cb4_R37_6R2oiw6JZECHAPw3MquHK7qNYGKzrVQ1pLnVW4TV_AU_gdkA04mTKBboNyQ0mJytAEMqmQUgCsHHB4QLFm7Dv7Y4JEXumWATWGd_EcKhTRpLCPAOJyklO9nyYkgi5OOi--fEkga9K3QxF36Jwu3JgkfID_u00fLVqkkOEFHAUmmvM-npLqoqzQ.png)

But what happened to Musical.ly’s co-founders after Musical.ly shut down? Well, both Zhu and Yang stayed with ByteDance after the acquisition and continued to work with the company on TikTok after their project was merged into it.

Zhu made the following statement about the merger:

_“Combining Musical.ly and TikTok is a natural fit given the shared mission of both experiences — to create a community where everyone can be a creator.”_



## Why Did Musical.ly Shut Down?

The main reason why ByteDance decided to shut down Musical.ly and combine it with TikTok was to take advantage of its user base and technology.

At the time of the merger, TikTok was very popular in China but struggled to expand into foreign markets. As we discussed above, Musical.ly did the opposite and was very popular in international markets, especially in the United States.

So, rather than split resources between two very similar apps with different markets, it made the most sense for ByteDance to simply fuse them and combine their hundreds of millions of users into one platform. 

By merging the two popular video-sharing platforms, ByteDance could focus all its resources on marketing and developing just one platform. 

It’s also likely that ByteDance saw merging the two user bases as a way to be more competitive with other social media giants, such as Facebook, that were also growing in terms of video sharing.

In short, the acquisition and shutdown of Musical.ly was a mutually beneficial deal that allowed ByteDance to accelerate TikTok’s growth into one of the world’s most popular social media platforms.

## Wrapping Up

Musical.ly is not a failed startup — it didn’t shut down because of doing anything wrong. In fact, Musical.ly is a prime example of a company that did everything _right_.

Like many startup founders, Musical.ly’s co-founders had to pivot from their initial idea to finding one that worked, and they seem to have done so at just the right time.

In the case of Musical.ly, the co-founders were able to capitalize on the popularity of social media and lip-syncing videos with the teen and pre-teen markets, particularly in the United States, and their app really took off running.

Because of its massive success in just a few years, Musical.ly caught the eye of its competitors, and the company was able to close a very lucrative acquisition deal with ByteDance.

Musical.ly’s co-founders were even able to continue working on their product in its new form as part of TikTok, and parts of Musical.ly live on through the massively popular social video-sharing platform.## What was Anki?

Anki was a robotics and AI startup founded in 2010 that aimed to integrate robotics and IoT (Internet of Things) into children's toys and games. Anki programmed objects so that they could be intelligent and adapt to the physical world, with the aim of solving the problems of positioning, reasoning, and execution in artificial intelligence and robotics. 

Their first successful product was the Anki Drive; which combined a toy racing car and track set with an iOS app for controlling and programming the toy cars.

![Anki](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/658deb34352dc16d8ae51654_Anki-min.webp)

Anki also released other successful products like Anki Overdrive (the successor of Anki Drive) and an interactive toy robot called Cozmo, as well as a more advanced version of Cozmo, called the Vector.

The sophistication of Cozmo even made it to Carnegie Mellon University (the founders’ alma mater), where it was used for college-level robotics classes. Cozmo, in fact, came with programing tools ranging from a simple drag-and-drop interface based on MIT’s Scratch Blocks to a full software development kit in the Python programming language.

According to Boris Sofman, the company’s CEO and co-founder, their goal was to create robots that “feel alive.” This included creating naturalistic imperfections in how they moved around, for example. This was in order to make them appear more lifelike to their human companions.

Anki’s Cozmo and its successor Vector were 2 products that showed quite a high level of sophistication in what was coined as "AI emotional intelligence"; which in other words means the capacity to show "emotion" to new stimuli.

The company received $50 million in Series A and Series B venture funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Two Sigma. In September 2014, Anki announced that it had raised another $55 million in Series C venture funding led by JP Morgan.

In June 2016, the company announced its latest round of funding, which amounted to $52.5M, also led by JP Morgan. The total funding to date is $182.5 million.  

## Why did Anki fail and shut down?

Anki barely lasted for a decade and completely ceased operations by the end of April 2019. This is not something you would expect from a company that is a brainchild of Carnegie Mellon graduates, and a company that raised close to $200 million in VC funding.

The products that Anki produced were also performing really well in the market and at a competitive price tag of under $300, they seemed to do what their competitors in this industry could not. In fact, according to many sources (like Amazon US), Cozmo was the best selling toy of 2017. So what took this promising startup eventually to the grave?

A failed round of financing was reportedly to blame. CEO Boris Sofman told employees that a deal had failed to materialize “at the last minute”, as it also happened with acquisition interests from companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Comcast.

An article published by The Robot Report provides some more information about Anki’s case. According to it, Silicon Valley Bank had a security interest in Anki’s copyrights, patents, and trademarks since March 30, 2018.

To receive a loan from SVB, Anki had to put up its intellectual property as collateral. If Anki failed to repay the loan, SVB had the right to seize the collateral to make up for the money it lost in the loan.

The report also stated that Fisher & Richardson, a global IP law firm, filed a lien against Anki on June 3, 2019, because it “has not been compensated for patent and trademark prosecution services that it provided for Anki”.

However, can these financial debacles be the sole reason, or is there something inherent within the robotics industry that is to blame? 

A quick look at the failure of other robotics companies within the last year paints a very clear picture. There needs to be a rethink as to the functionality and not just the novelty factor (which tends to fade out very quickly) when thinking of designing the next successful home robot.

It is like what Roomba and Alexa have done within the past decade (specialized and functional robots that actually do the job they are meant for).    

A major failure, for example, was Jibo, founded in 2012 by famed MIT roboticist Cynthia Breazeal (a pioneer researcher in human-robot interaction). Jibo went on to successfully raise over $3.5 million when its Indiegogo campaign ended in 2014.

They raised a further $73 million in VC funding and Jibo was touted as the first social robot for the home that would actually dance around for you! Another similar failure was the shutdown of Mayfield Robotics.

They had released their famed Kuri robot that was touted as being a roaming security camera with a personality. Both robots came with a high price tag and their novelty wore off among users very soon, leading to their shutdowns in late 2018. 

The epic failure of Cozmo and Vector proved the fact even further that despite a successful product line and competitive price tags if products (no matter how well designed) do not prove their value in the consumer market, they will not lead to a sustainable business model for the companies investing in them.![Appiterate](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/60535da44466ea433b91d5d6_5c564b10530958d9864654f7_30%25252520Appiterate.webp)

## What was Appiterate?

Appiterate was a mobile marketing company, which specializes in creating “precise and targeted” user experience based on the user’s previous activity on both applications and websites. Appiterate delivered a lot of personalized notifications on its campaigns each month, roughly around 100 million targeted and specific notifications for various platforms of different e-commerce sites. This target-specific campaign technique by Appiterate landed some huge scores for those e-commerce sites who reportedly had a whopping 300% increase in their total revenue.

## Why did Appiterate fail and shut down?

Appiterate didn’t technically fail but was rather acquired by Flipkart. Flipkart is India’s largest e-commerce company. The company has been serving their customers mainly on their online website, Flipkart.com, but things started to change when Flipkart saw how lucrative mobile phone apps were becoming. For over the last few years, the company noticed that their overall traffic mostly came from smartphones and tablets. The only logical move for the company to maximize their profits was to move on and develop a mobile phone-based application for their e-commerce website.

This is where Appiterate comes in. The startup vast experience working with e-commerce sites made them the perfect candidate for Flipkart’s acquisition. Appiterate services were deemed perfect for Flipkart’s goal to expand their sales by moving on with the trends and focusing more on developing a mobile-based campaign strategy for the growing Indian market and the deal went through in 2015.

ArsDigita was a Massachusetts based Web Development Company established in 1997. Its fundamental product was an open source toolbox called the ArsDigita Community System (ACS) that aimed to help support entrepreneurs who had an online business with their group sites by introducing the ArsDigita database. The database would prompt smooth exchanges processing, with consistent work process in every aspect of the E-organizations. The positive development of ArsDigita prompted the formation of the ArsDigita Foundation, that awarded ArsDigita prize yearly to secondary school students. The foundation also supported post-high school students to undertake a one-year software engineering course at an undergraduate level.

## Why did ArsDigita fail and shut down?

Following three years of successful business, ArsDigita began encountering a descending pattern in April 2000. Their decline was ascribed to the procuring of an inexperienced external CEO and the enablement of more power to the financial supporters of the startup. The new group of leaders utilized twofold the speculation beforehand, declined a lucrative offer by Microsoft that could set the organization upon an upward trajectory, and disliked the key organization item, ACS, even though it had repeatedly been used to take care of genuine business issues and made the organization one of a kind and effective.

To exacerbate the situation, they supplanted the ACS with another, mostly closed-source programming bundle that was difficult to utilize, had genuine execution issues and met just a little part of the business needs. Also, they fundamentally expanded the cost of the task by multiplying the number of representatives and making new, generously compensated official positions. The new administration likewise misused the funding. The situation kept on deteriorating until the company finally shut down in April of 2001.

ChaCha was a bit of “fresh air” being blown into the search engine industry. Back in 2006 when Facebook was in its infant years and Google had sort of established itself as a frontrunner to being the number one search engine on the Internet, ChaCha arrived seemingly out of nowhere.

![Chacha Search Engine](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/658e286495b2afce327c38a0_Chacha-min.webp)

In short, what the startup offered was a search engine where you could interact with a live human being - a “guide” of sorts, and then get the guides to manually search for the things that you were looking for on the Internet.

So basically you just sat in the comforts of your own home and instead of having to search for things on your own, you could get someone to do it for you. What you did was simply logging on a chat interface and you told the guide what to search for. You could also chat and interact with the guide during the search.

## Why did ChaCha fail and shut down?

To understand why ChaCha failed it’s important that you understand how search engines functioned back in 2006 and the early 2000’s. Back in the day, you couldn’t just type one single word and the search engine would find every, single relevant result, including results ‘near you’, as Google can nowadays.   

No, you really had to dig deep to find exactly what you were looking for. Search engines weren’t as complex as they are now, and their algorithms certainly didn’t do much of the thinking for you.

In many cases, you had to manually search at least 3-4 pages of the search engine before you found a decent result, and even then it wasn’t as tailored to your request as it is nowadays. 

If you needed something specific found on the Internet, you needed a librarian who could quickly scout through a number of articles, websites and publications.

A lot of the people who really understood how to find information fast on the Internet had a master’s degree because it was so complex and difficult to scour through the tons of information without any proper algorithm. 

However, ChaCha soon got stiff competition. Google released its Panda algorithm back in 2011 that virtually put it as the de facto information source on the Internet. If you searched for something on Google, you would be lucky to find results from sites like ChaCha, Ask.com, and Answers.com. They all got pushed further down. 

Not only that but at its peak, ChaCha had 55,000 virtual employees. They faced big management problems and there were even some cultural issues they had to take care of as well. The costs of hiring people to manual do research simply became too high, when comparing them with the results you could get from Google. And in addition, it became more difficult for the guides to give proper answers on subjective matters like politics, religion and so on. 

Ultimately, hiring people to manually search and give answers to questions wasn’t a sustainable project when Google offered the same thing, only through a simple online search.



## Is Chacha still a thing?  

Unfortunately, ChaCha is no longer a thing. The combination of advanced search engine algorithms, like Google and the high operational costs made the service unsustainable.

Founded in 2013, Circle Back Lending was launched as an online personal loans marketplace connecting potential borrowers with lenders who could lend them any amount ranging from $1000 payday loans to $35,000 Personal Loans for longer-term reasons (ranging from 36 to 60 months). The APR (Annual Percentage Rate) offered on these loans ranged from 6.63 to 35.82 % (credit cards have an APR between 17-24 %). Circle Back promised a quick inquiry process and a private and secure system that would send cash directly to your account after contact with and approval by a verified and registered lender.

## Why did Circle Back Lending fail and shut down?

The company saw some success initially and entered into a partnership with Jefferies Group LLC that was to help with the sale and securitization of $500 million in principal amount of consumer loans. The stated goal of this partnership with an established financial services firm was to provide loans to a much wider segment of the US population, which needed a responsible alternative to traditional bank loans and credit cards.

3 years down the line, the company was exposed in an article by Bloomberg that it had stopped giving out loans. This was mainly a result of borrowers failing to pay their loans.

For starters, in 2014, the company had generated a minuscule $4m in total loans (a year into its founding), but that didn’t stop Jefferies Group LLC from agreeing to securitize up to $500m of its loans. This is nothing new in the fin-tech world as shown by the $5 billion dollar deal that was inked in 2017 by industry leader Prosper (founded in 2005). Prosper Inc., which had been one of the pioneers of the P2P Online lending industry, was one of the earliest to turn to Wall Street to securitize its loans by repackaging them as bonds through the likes of Citigroup and others.

Then there has been a problem with the sudden firing of CEO s and top staff that was a regular occurrence at both Prosper, and Lending Club (another pioneer in the P2P lending business). The unexpected departure of Lending Club’s founding CEO put the entire industry in a tailspin as funding dried up.

Despite this, there seem to be much bigger and more fundamental problems that the entire P2P lending industry is ignoring.

1\. With the advent of online banking, and the P2P companies relying on their own credit rating (like FICO), the line between banks and P2P lending has become blurred, and they are constantly diverging from the reason that this industry was founded (providing loans to those seen outside the scope of banks).

2\. A far bigger problem that exists is the staggering rate at which P2P companies fail at returning capital to investors. A closer look into the P2P lending industry in China reveals some crucial data. The P2P industry fulfilled a growing need in the country, where bank loans were much harder to get by. But by the end of 2015, there were 1,031 total troubled platforms out of 3,448 platforms still in operation, with most of the problems being people that absconded with the cash. Despite much-needed regulation of the industry starting in 2018, the total number of platforms that went bust as of February 2019 were over 5000, with 177 million RMB ($25 million) in unpaid loans.

## What was Dazo?

Dazo was a food tech startup based in Bangalore which emerged as a “food on demand” company that partnered with few selected restaurants and took care of the food delivery logistics. Hungry customers could find and order their perfect meal within seconds of opening the app, according to the startup founders. Dazo (formerly TapCibo) achieved this by analyzing and saving users’ behavior, preferences and direct feedback. The startup counter-intuitive approach of only working with about 20 restaurants that offered different cuisines was based on the (true) assumption that hungry customers had no patience for going through dozens of restaurants menus and reviews. What they needed was the best food delivered within minutes for an affordable price, and this is exactly what Dazo was about.

## Why did Dazo fail and shut down?

Two of the main reasons the company decided to shut shop were fierce competition and lack of funding.

Heavy capital investment is essential in the food-tech industry and Dazo started running low on funding.

The high competition in the sector led companies to slash their prices until practically no company could make substantial revenue from the sector and the cost of client acquisition actually increased. Needless to say, Dazo struggled to find funds and the company opted for ceasing its operations within a year of their launch.

Design Inc. was a startup that linked clients to talented designers. Clients would post on the site the projects they needed to get done. Design Inc. allowed designers to autonomously send proposals for the projects they would like to work on while charging a small fee for it. The platform helped designers all over the world to find their dream projects and companies were happy to be able to choose from a talented pool of designers.

## Why did Design Inc. fail and shut down?

Design Inc. reached market saturation after some time. The number of projects and companies were not increasing and the startup could not make enough revenue to cover operation costs. This put the company in a low cash situation and they founder took the decision to close it down.

Design Inc. CEO identified a number of reasons that he believed contributed to the failure of his company. He stated that he should have been more focused on the essentials of business, which is getting more leads and profit. He also mentioned that a startup founder should also test his assumptions and keep on optimizing the product in every little way. Team members should also be encouraged to experiment without fear.

Another broader issue that is not exclusively linked to Design Inc. may be with the business model itself since the design field is considered a top-end market where job posts are scarce by nature. Too many designers compete for only a limited number of design jobs, thus causing the market to saturate too soon. Another reason why the company might have not witnessed a growth in its network could have been due to the fact that although designers are introduced to the clients by Design Inc. platform, in the end, they might decide to continue their business transactions independently from the marketplace.

Digg stated mission on launching was that of ‘democratizing’ the content and news that people saw.

The concept was simple: anyone that found interesting content could ‘digg it’ and post it on the Digg site. The post and stories that received the most amount of upvotes were featured on Digg’s front page getting thus maximum exposure.

The site was initially a place for geeky and tech content but it soon grew to incorporate various types of content.

## Why did Digg fail and shut down?

Digg is a site that missed the opportunity to become a thriving social network. The site is still active but even one of its former CEOs posts more frequently on Twitter than on his own site.

The reason Digg failed were interlinked and quite obvious to point out in hindsight.

First of all, it failed to carry on with its mission of offering a platform that was free of any group’s agenda.

As a matter of fact, anyone with a large circle of friends or with a numerous follower’s base (or the highest number of fake accounts) could message their posts to get the most amount of upvotes within hours, not because of the quality of the content of the post, but simply because of the connections that that specific ‘power user’ had.

In an attempt to remedy to this, the site disabled the messaging feature it had and only allowed sharing with their friends by means of Facebook and Twitter. As you can imagine, the move didn’t do them any good, not only that, but it left their users dissatisfied (to say the least) by the newly implemented restriction.

And yet, these were not the only changes Digg’s team made that distanced its users. In 2010, Digg came back with a new design that, alas, had even fewer features. Digg v4, as it was called, did away with features such as down voting posts, saving favorites and posting videos.

Digg had the advantage of being the early mover since it was founded in 2004 and valued at $160 million in 2008, but it failed to adapt to its growing user base and renew the mission it had. Another bookmarking site, Reddit, slowly but inevitably started to catch up with it.

As Digg users left the platform in 2010, there was Reddit offering them a ready and welcoming alternative. The interesting and inviting thing about Reddit, which is basically a spinoff of Digg, was that user content was encouraged and this allowed the platform to thrive. In short, Digg failed to adapt to its market and capture a mainstream audience.

Self-promotion and publishing of one’s own content on Digg, instead, seemed to be frowned upon. Reddit valued and nurtured its community in ways Digg wasn’t able to do.

There were rumors that Digg would be brought back and improved upon as an app, but even so, by now it would face quite a bit of competition.

Dinnr was a web platform which allowed customers to select a recipe on the website and order pre-measured ingredients accompanied with printed instruction which would be delivered to them on the same day. The only item clients were required to have at home, besides an equipped kitchen, were oil, salt, and pepper. Dinnr did not provide readymade food, it only provided the customer with ingredients and instructions. An exception was made on popular celebrations like Valentine’s Day, Christmas, and Thanksgiving, where they actually offered special ready to eat meals.

## Why did Dinnr fail and shut down?

Dinnr failed because from the beginning there wasn’t a real market need for the business. Besides, if people had markets and superstores close to them (as it is often the case in developed countries), there would be no need for them to order ingredient when they could go themselves and buy what they needed. Dinnr concentrated on providing and delivering ingredient but the reality is that most potential customers would have rather ordered ready-made meals instead of only ingredient which will then have to prepare. And while the product might have been useful in some cases, the demand for the product was low and it resulted in low-profit margin.

The Dinnr team seems to have developed a product that they personally liked without conducting thorough market research first. They conducted few interviews and concentrated on marketing their service rather than inquiring on the challenges the average customer faces with grocery shopping. They overlooked the fact that pitching a product instead of conducting solid market research gives great statistics on paper but will often lead to nothing but disappointment after the product launches.

Moreover, when starting out, Dinnr, set high monthly goals for themselves but they were too ambitious and failure to meet their own expectations might have dealt them an ulterior mental blow.

## Why did Glitch Shut Down?

If you go through our [**failed startups**](https://www.failory.com/interviews?type-of-interview=Failed%20startup), you might notice a pattern. A significant portion of the interviewed founders of unsuccessful projects is currently working for new, successful ventures.

It’s not a rare occurrence for a failed startup project to succeed, directly or indirectly (due to accumulated experience, know-how, etc.). There are few better examples of this than Glitch - the failed online game that gave birth to Slack, an internal communication tool for companies recently acquired by Salesforce for the whopping $27.7 billion in cash and stock.

Glitch was a project of Steward Butterfield’s game development studio, Tiny Speck. Steward was already a prominent entrepreneur in the tech industry, as he had previously founded Flickr, one of the social web pioneers, which Yahoo bought in 2005. This allowed him to enjoy a head start for his new game dev company - he secured a $1.5 million seed round followed by an additional $10.7 million from Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners - the VC funds which backed Facebook and Instagram.

Tiny Speck used their newly-acquired resources to create their first product - a creative and highly non-standard game called Glitch.  

![Glitch Game Illustration](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/61b0938e7fde45dc6cf8a4ec_QOXTEKR2rHENHFvLrGyV5zJwHeTApGLORNLgGKkQ5mbnZAuLPxGGys1ytETLuloqH2o-HS9zGtnyQb2Q4GD86h91_3piSjfYWnVWkdQ1Hf0bNC0fbNK1p08XfNdOC9Lr__LhZXgg.jpeg)

 “The game was absolutely preposterous. And yet, we kind of liked it.”



Glitch was an innovative project mainly because it mixed massive multiplayer online (commonly known as MMO) gameplay in a casual browser game. Glitch deliberately steered away from combat mechanics, and instead focused on collaborative gathering of resources and crafting. The main reason to perform the crafting was the ability to shape the shared online world - for example by growing plants and trees or by cooking food.

The game was leaning heavily on social interactions - players could join groups that functioned like chat rooms (and were equivalent to the guild mechanic that traditional MMORPGs like WoW have). Moreover, in the later stages of the game’s development Guides were introduced, who were players chosen by the staff to help new players learn the game in a specially-made introductory area.

The business model of Glitch was free-to-play with in-game transactions. This means that the average customer lifetime value is comparatively low (e.g. Farmville averages $1 per player), and in order to be profitable the game needs a substantial player number - the Tiny Speck team was aiming at 200,000 players. Despite finding a dedicated core audience, Glitch never managed to reach this milestone.

In 2011 the team reverted the game to beta status to work on several core improvements with the hope to attract a larger audience, but this attempt to iterate ultimately wasn’t successful.

In 2012 the decision was taken to close Glitch down. The [**official announcement**](http://web.archive.org/web/20121119062458/http://www.glitch.com/closing/#3) of the closure said that Tiny Speck had failed to find a buyer for the game who was willing to keep it running, as it was expensive to run.

The announcement also noted that the company had bet heavily on Adobe’s Flash technology, which was quickly becoming dated and was very poorly adapted to mobile - the direction most online games of this nature were going. This created production problems - it was taking the development team too much time to develop and introduce fun features, which is a big problem for a product that is already launched. Every day the core gameplay loops are not fun-enough, the game is losing players. It’s very hard to find sustainable growth with bad customer retention.

Glitch was a very innovative game, but this was also a major reason it faced problems attracting an audience. Most gamers were uncertain what they were looking at and a large majority lacked the patience to explore and find out where the fun was. As a whole, the game made a poor job of onboarding new players, which is a fatal flaw for a totally innovative and unfamiliar product.

In an [**interview for gamedeveloper.com**](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-story-of-i-glitch-i-why-this-odd-mmo-is-shutting-down) Butterfield said: _"A lot of people were just like 'I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do.' Some people took 'I don't know what I'm supposed to do' as an invitation to explore and ended up loving it. Other people closed the browser. That's it."_

After it became obvious the game was failing to generate meaningful player base growth, closing doors became the obvious choice from the viewpoint of the founder and the investors. Even though the shutdown decision was abrupt for employees, Tiny Speck actively tried to help their former employees find new employment opportunities and avoided any backlash.

The company was left with $6m in cash at the moment of Glitch’s closure, but instead of returning the money to investors, Butterfield convinced them to allow him to keep a small core team and to try to develop and commercialize a communication tool that the team had developed internally while working on Glitch.

Despite initially thinking _“it sounds like a really horrible idea,”_, Ben Horowitz (of Andreessen Horowitz) was eventually convinced and let Butterfield run with it.

The communication tool that allowed the Tiny Speck team to avoid internal email grew to become Slack (an acronym for _“Searchable Log of All Communication and Knowledge”_) - one of the most successful enterprise communication tools and one of the fastest-growing business software in history, having reached 60k daily active users and 15k paying customers just 10 weeks after exiting closed beta.

Arguably, one of the most valuable takeaways from the Glitch to Slack story is the importance of avoiding the sunk cost fallacy. Plenty of experienced startup founders have noticed the importance of the ability to “kill your darlings”. It’s easy to get attached to your creation and to try to fix it in perpetuity, but this is usually a losing strategy in the land of startups. Most startup projects fail - an inability to let go of bad ideas would prevent you from discovering good ones. 

Steward Butterfield could have easily decided to use the remaining $6m to try to fix Glitch. Still, the game’s outlook wasn’t great, so he made the correct decision to kill it and invest the remaining resources into a new idea.

This was not an easy decision to make:

_“I remember that morning; we were going to have an all-hands…getting up in front of the whole company, and then locking eyes with this guy who just had started maybe 3 months before, and I had really pursued him. I got him to move to a new city, he had a 22-year-old daughter, he bought a new house, he was moving away from his in-laws who were helping to take care of the kids, it was just how much of a disruption to someone’s life that was…And then to say, 'Thank you for your faith in me, you no longer have a job.' So that was really, really hard.”_

Yet, as the well-known stoic quote from Jerzy Gregorek states: _“Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.”_

Not downsizing the company and continuing work on the game because of the expectations of the users and employees would have just delayed the inevitable end and would have made it more painful as a whole. And more importantly - it wouldn’t have left the space needed for Slack to become a reality.

Slack (and by extension Glitch) is one of the projects that we explore in our [**Product-Market Fit e-book**](https://www.failory.com/product-market-fit), so if you want to dive deeper and see how some great companies managed to find the startup Holy Grail make sure to check it out!Founded in 2007, Justin.tv was a live streaming platform that eventually gave way to video game-focused live streaming giant Twitch.

Over its seven years in existence before shutting down in 2014, Justin.tv hosted countless live streams of everything from sports to video game gameplays. 

Although the platform had its fair share of problems and controversies, that’s not why Justin.tv shut down — at least not directly. 

In this article, we’re going to take a closer look at Justin.tv’s rise and fall to see what we can learn from the live streaming pioneer’s journey.



## What Was Justin.tv?

Justin.tv was a website that revolutionized the streaming of live videos on the internet by regular people. The platform was an instant success, largely due to the fact that many users streamed sports events in its early days.

![Justin.tv](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/63504e25ef0e7c3c2370a54c_wDXgu1zfQ_l8vW4cFpMhgsD41TMdM_-2btOTYpJ6fESVmQ4ruPTVzq85tXQw-pH3Lv_KYarPE2AftXKD4dtyPwexeTSgf-F1B7cN329I6rKn4vmjAN_janK4pfECRfTd8Gp1W3oacbbqLlCBJ7TA8xGP5Bi3hYBroPGNH00AYiTCSGbOherLe7zNRg.webp)

However, streaming sports without a license is illegal as it’s a form of piracy, and this led to some legal troubles for the live streaming site, ultimately causing the company to pivot to video game streaming.

Initially, Justin.tv created a category for video game streaming on the site, which it called Twitch, eventually creating a separate site for Twitch in 2011. 

By 2014 Twitch was so popular that Justin.tv renamed itself to Twitch Interactive and shut down the Justin.tv website, focusing solely on the Twitch brand and video game content.

We’ll go into more detail about all the different stages of Justin.tv’s life below.



## How Was Justin.tv Started?

Justin.tv was launched in 2007 by co-founders Justin Kan, Emmett Shear, Michael Siebel, and Kyle Vogt.

![Justin.tv's founders](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/63504e2511316e3f68a68b92_hKKAkWBMuHkP6HLIphLzYzxQpUafKVvYWRdJdxwxz_pCVVPMRdAWaMs8QvUvwd5MkBJgq-TWkNu-c0Zl4eFanyIw0kxnm82D59acNStk7MK2oXBx9z5Q17yTnhcY6qWE-Y7r8bGlP5F4LoTWv4cfd1ZSzrn0McHFE6J0UX4IRtUfVKylkQMJftSEsw.webp)

Prior to this, in 2005, Kan and Shear worked on an idea for a digital calendar app that integrated with Gmail and other email apps.

During this time, a friend of Kan introduced him to the founder of Y Combinator, Paul Graham, and Kan and Shear were accepted into YC’s accelerator program, which gave them $12,000 to work on their idea.

The co-founders released the calendar app, called [**Kiko**](https://www.failory.com/cemetery/kiko), in August of 2005, and it experienced enough success to earn them another $50,000 in funding from investors.

Despite its potential, Kiko didn’t survive after Gmail launched its proprietary Google Calendar app, and Kan and Shear decided to try and sell Kiko on eBay. Surprisingly enough, they sold Kiko for a nice sum of $258,000!

Now, this was right around the time that YouTube had been launched and was taking off, and the concept inspired Kan and Shear to start working on their second startup idea: a live streaming service.

The two co-founders got together with Michael Siebel and Kyle Vogt, who Shear had met at Yale University, to work on the idea that became Justin.tv.

Justin.tv was originally created as a way for Kan to broadcast his life 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The term coined for this at the time was “lifecasting.”

Kan streamed literally everything, even very intimate moments like going on dates. From time to time he would pass the camera equipment off to someone else to take a break from streaming for a day or so, but he always remained the star of the show.

Other Justin.tv users could comment on Kan’s stream in a public chat room, and there were often thousands of people watching what was going on in his life at once.

Because it was so unique at the time, Justin.tv received instant media attention, which helped contribute to its early success.

But Kan stopped broadcasting his life later that same year and he and the other co-founders pivoted on their idea and decided to focus on making Justin.tv a site for anyone to broadcast anything. 

They financed this development by raising $8 million from Alsop Louie Partners and Felicis Ventures and relaunched Justin.tv in October of 2007. 

For the relaunch, Justin.tv’s co-founders were even able to get the Jonas Brothers to host a livestream, which attracted a whopping 80,000 watchers.

Justin.tv’s co-founders eventually added more than 60 different live streaming categories to the site, including gaming, sports, music, entertainment, animals, lifecasting, and more.

Sports streams quickly became one of the most popular categories on Justin.tv and were the biggest single source of traffic to the site, especially over weekends and during popular sports seasons, like NFL season and NCAA playoff season. 

By July of 2008, the platform already had [**more than a million registered users**](https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/21/justintv-reaches-1-million-users/), and by 2009 Justin.tv had attained a user base of an impressive 21 million people.

Justin.tv’s creators continued to refine the site and began looking for ways to generate revenue, as they were still just living off of the funding they raised. 

They introduced sponsored channels in September of 2008, partnering with advertisers like the ecommerce shopping channel The Talk Market, which was backed by Amazon.



## How Did Justin.tv Work?

In order to log in and use Justin.tv, users just had to create an account using their email or a social media account, such as their Facebook.

Once someone created an account, they could watch live streams in any of the dozens of categories on the site, or start streaming themselves using a webcam or mobile phone, all for free. Audio streams without video were also possible, and users often broadcast music.

Users could chat with each other and comment on the content being streamed on the thousands of channels live at any given time.

In fact, there were already 30,000+ live stream broadcasting channels to choose from by April of 2008, [**according to co-founder Justin Kan**](https://www.yourtechstory.com/2019/04/20/justin-kan-serial-entrepreneur-founded-lifecasting-platform-twitch/).

Some of Justin.tv’s broadcasting channels were formed in partnerships with other media companies, such as Fox Corporation, and featured branded content from these companies.



### Justin.tv’s Technical Specifications and Functionalities

All live streaming on Justin.tv was done using Adobe Flash. Justin.tv’s website used Flash to auto-detect webcams and stream from them, so users could broadcast directly through the site.

Additionally, Justin.tv supported third-party streaming software, including QuickTime Broadcaster, Camtwist, D3DGear Broadcaster, Flash Media Encoder, Wirecast, Open Broadcaster Software, FFSplit Broadcaster, XSplit Broadcaster and VLC.

Streamers could use such software to add special effects to or improve the quality of their streams.

Using software to improve the quality of videos allowed users to bypass Justin.tv’s limitations, which were set at maximums of 1,000 kbps for video streams and 44 kHz for audio streams.

Users could also choose to enable or disable the ability to embed their channels in other sites.

In terms of languages, the US-based Justin.tv site was strictly in English, but translation into other languages was supported. The platform reached full translation into Spanish and Catalan, and 50% or more translation into 17 other languages.



## What Were Justin.tv’s Problems?

Justin.tv experienced a variety of problems and controversies before it eventually shut down. These included dangerous pranks, pirated live stream content, and even a tragic death broadcast live.

None of these were directly responsible for what happened to Justin.tv, but they did play a role in Justin-tv’s evolutions and eventual reformation into Twitch.



### Pranks During Justin Kan’s Lifecasting

Justin.tv’s problems started early, when it was still just an outlet for founder Justin Kan to stream his own life 24/7.

Justin was occasionally the target of dangerous pranks, including swat-style pranks in which the perpetrators called 911 and falsely reported crimes or emergencies, such as a stabbing and a fire, in Justin’s apartment.

Of course, emergency services including the police and the fire department had to respond to these calls, and Justin’s number eventually got flagged by 911 operators, resulting in him having to change it.

These pranks were partly responsible for Justin pivoting on his startup idea and relaunching Justin.tv as a full live streaming platform with his friends and co-founders, Emmett Shear, Michael Siebel, and Kyle Vogt.

So, even though these pranks didn’t directly lead to Justin.tv shutting down, they are an important part of its story because they influenced the form in which it operated.



### Justin.tv’s Suicide Broadcast

Justin.tv’s saddest problem occurred early in its life, on November 19, 2008. On this day, a 19-year-old man named Abraham K. Biggs, who was suffering from bi-polar disorder, [**broadcast his own drug-induced suicide**](https://www.wired.com/2008/11/teen-kills-self/) to viewers via his Justin.tv streaming channel.

![Justin.tv's broadcast](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/63504e25e3a3e721f1c66897_qbI_K-4YT2VVNrfvAQZ0JWOdMnhInQ-6Y6VnfubDfe59MoeTEm0bSlKQnDkbqaQ3bM6zODeMnlOcpaphoeUv6AHbxDNkFKOrqf4OYCKIZH8H6k8_rlcvoNVi8mF3RM-1sYu2-JYreIcajJrIwM9tutXEKwfL3xCN7rsOPzUHQWj-FBT9OFn0ukMSfg.webp)

Michael Seibel, Justin.tv’s CEO, made the following statement on the matter:

_“We regret that this has occurred and respect the privacy of the broadcaster and his family during this time. We have policies in place to discourage the distribution of distressing content and our community monitors the site accordingly. This content was flagged by our community, reviewed and removed according to our terms of service.”_

Justin.tv was not held liable in any way for the young man’s death, so we can’t say that this sad and unfortunate incident had any notable impact on what happened to Justin.tv, but Biggs’ father did blame Justin.tv’s viewers and the platform in part for his son’s suicide.



### Illegal Live Streams on Justin.tv

As we mentioned earlier, pirated sports streams were a big reason for Justin.tv’s early success, as they attracted millions of viewers to the platform to watch everything from football to UFC.

![Justin.tv sports](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/63504e26be00fc7228ec4681_f1xQ5I-RnPv0knV7XHR5cb--dfMZtfabxtpGHbjoPIQtNbebxCfFpX504t41JPyqyKq8CXShWNLEuNQXzTHlozlCjeEbC63BxfrBJkL1JAQcGqRVLPHw1LmMUcvrjMhcG8LrOXb4ndQu4zyOUhdoB1p7DNugfG3iMsNa9Ba4jnJYO76f-ZHbVMu42g.webp)

However, this quickly drew negative attention from authorized broadcasters in the United States, the United Kingdom, and even Australia.

Several lawsuits were filed against Justin.tv, and the company was forced to try and do more to stop illegal broadcasts or potentially face the same fate as other pirate sites that were getting shut down left and right at the time.

One way Justin.tv did this was by partnering with Vobile and Fox to automatically scan streams for copyrighted content. Part of the deal struck was that Fox would not sue Justin.tv as long as it was making efforts to remove streams that were infringing on Fox’s copyrights.

In 2009, Justin.tv’s CEO Michael Siebel had to go and testify in front of a House Judiciary Committee hearing on sports piracy.

The pressure on the streaming platform was mounting, and Justin.tv had to hire a team of lawyers to combat their various legal problems.

As Justin.tv began taking down more and more illegal live streams, its traffic also began to nosedive.

In 2010, after all of this had been going on for a while, Justin.tv’s traffic dropped by as much as 20%, or about five million users.

Despite Justin.tv’s best efforts to fight piracy and appease the various organizations suing them, the legal troubles continued into 2011, when the UFC filed a lawsuit against the company.

These legal issues were perhaps the most indirectly responsible for Justin.tv’s shut down — 2011 was also when the company pivoted again by spinning its Twitch video game streaming category off into its own standalone streaming site.

There were many reasons why the creators of Justin.tv decided to launch Twitch as a separate platform, but one of the biggest reasons was that there were no copyright issues associated with video game streaming content.

Video game gameplay also happened to be one of Justin.tv’s most popular categories, after sports streams.

Additionally, video game studios were happy to work with Justin.tv on eSport event content. This was quite the polar opposite of what Justin.tv had been experiencing with other types of sports content.



## Why Was Justin.tv Shut Down?

In 2011, shortly after Justin.tv launched Twitch as a separate streaming site, the company’s original founder Justin Kan, whom the site was named after, decided to part ways with his creation and work on other startup ideas.

Due to Twitch’s massive popularity — it had already reached more than one billion minutes of viewed video game gameplay content in the first few months — the remaining co-founders decided to focus most of their energy on growing the Twitch brand.

After three years of operating as an offshoot of Justin.tv, Twitch took over as the primary brand, and the company Justin.tv was renamed to Twitch Interactive in February of 2014.

A few months later, the Twitch team announced that they would delete all of Justin.tv’s archived content, which marked the true beginning of the end for Justin.tv.

Around this time, rumors began circulating that Google and YouTube were both interested in acquiring Twitch.

Finally, on August 5, 2014, Justin.tv’s co-founders announced that they were shutting down their original platform for good.

[**They made the following statement**](https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/05/justin-tv-shuts-down-to-let-the-company-focus-on-twitch/) about their decision to shut Justin.tv down:

_“Justin.tv pioneered live video on the Internet and spawned one of the largest video platforms ever: Twitch. Justin.tv was officially renamed Twitch Interactive Inc. in February of 2014 and Twitch is now the focus of the company’s resources. Unfortunately that means we need to shut down Justin.tv. We thank all of our broadcasters and viewers for 7 years of live video memories.”_

Less than a month later, Amazon announced that it had acquired Twitch for the massive sum of $970 million.

So, ultimately, the reason Justin.tv shut down was that it spawned Twitch, a much more popular streaming platform, and that Amazon acquired the new streaming service.

Although we don’t know all the details of the acquisition deal, it’s likely that Amazon didn’t want to buy Twitch with Justin.tv, as Justin.tv represented an unnecessary expense. 

There were also still issues related to pirated live streams on Justin.tv, which Amazon almost certainly wanted nothing to do with.

Since there were no copyright issues with Twitch and it was the more popular of the two streaming sites, this was what Amazon was really after, and Justin.tv’s co-founders probably decided to shut down the original site to seal the deal with Amazon and smooth the handover.



## Final Thoughts on Justin.tv’s Rise and Fall

Justin.tv wasn’t the world’s first live streaming platform, but it was responsible for taking live streaming to a whole new level and helping to popularize video game gameplay streaming.

Even though the site is no longer around today, can we really say Justin.tv failed? Well, not really.

If you consider the fact that Justin.tv gave birth to Twitch, the streaming platform with more than 30 million active users and millions of people watching streams at any given time, its journey was a successful one.

Justin.tv’s rise and fall is a prime example of how a startup idea can change over time to meet market pull and adapt to problems, eventually becoming a more polished, desirable product.

In the case of Justin.tv, its metamorphosis into Twitch led to an incredibly lucrative buyout by Amazon. 

Even though none of the countless hours of content streamed via Justin.tv during its seven years in action exist anymore and the site’s URL is defunct, its spirit lives on through Twitch, and the much-loved streaming platform is definitely not going anywhere anytime soon.

## What was Kitchit?

Kitchit mission was to make you enjoy the dining experience by letting you book local chefs and bringing them to your doorsteps. Meals were served at the client’s home and yet were more affordable and convenient than going to high-end restaurants. Kitchit offered three signature menus that featured starter, entrée, and dessert and had meals that would appeal to vegetarians as well. Unlike other service providers which delivered ready-made meals or sent ingredients only, Kitchit made sure to take care of the whole dining process from acquiring ingredients, cooking it and cleaning up afterwards.

## Why did Kitchit fail and shut down?

Kitchit was a popular service and people appreciated the fact that the experience the company brought them by allowing them to have tasty food at their own house and still being able to entertain guest instead of being busy in the kitchen. The on-demand food market was already very competitive and they had to compete with other food providers in the same market including Chef'd Up, ChefSurfing, VanChefs and Hire A Chef. Even well-funded ventures in this sector had tried making a profitable long-term business but failed. Kitchit changed business strategy a couple of times but was not able to make enough profit margin to sustain its operating costs.

Leap transit was a private transport service based in San Francisco, they offered bus services with eye-catching and comfortable interiors. Leap was supposed to fill a gap in the transport system by serving people that didn't want to pay for an Uber ride every day and yet preferred a quieter environment to the public transport offered in the city. The buses had Wi-Fi, leather seats, AC sockets. They also had a mini bar offering snacks and beverages.

## Why did Leap Transit fail and shut down?

The primary reason for Leap quick exit from the private transport scene was their failure to comply with the San Francisco regulations. Besides not having requested permission from the city administration, they committed a second infringement when they removed the front door ramp which by law should be present in bus to make the vehicle accessible to people with disabilities.

Furthermore, although their service might have been useful, it was seen with a mix of dislike and outrage. The original inhabitant of the city generally seemed to dislike bus services that seemed to be aimed at the new “tech population” that came into the city and they even went so far as to protest their very presence. Another complaint was also that the buses also congested the SF streets.

Leap had not enough passengers to make a decent profit, even if they charged them $6 per ride. When the California Public Utilities Commission issued a cease and desist notice to the company they halted their operations.

Maple was a startup that prepared and delivered meals in New York. It provided its customer with complimentary maple sugar cookie in every order made. Unlike others companies, maple gave full restaurant experience for it had its own apps, delivery staff, and kitchens. The idea was to have top chefs prepare the main menu and have satellite kitchens provide the complementary dishes. Since the business didn’t have to incur in the high expenses that come when opening an actual restaurant, they could afford to provide premium dishes at an affordable price.

## Why did Maple fail and shut down?

Maple’s original plan when they started out in 2015 was to offer customers great food at reasonable prices. However, leaked reports from the company revealed that Maple was losing money on each delivered meal and it only began making a 30 cents profit on meals from 2016. Although they first relied on their investor’s fundings to cover operational costs, the forecasted losses were too high and they wouldn't be able to sustain it. So, they increased the price, added delivery fees, and changed ways of computing sales tax. These sudden price increases led many customers to shift to other providers that offered the same or better services for less money.

Maple also spent a lot to buy expensive grass-fed beef, antibiotic-free chicken, and also imported pricey oils. Some sources claim that Maple lacked the operational chops to prepare and deliver meals on scale while maintaining quality and producing a profit. Maple kitchens were also not well equipped to cook 10,000 meals a day.

Furthermore, when Maple launched they used to give a complimentary maple sugar cookie, afterward they withdrew them saying that they were moving away from all kinds of non-natural products to good simple food. This might have ulteriorly displeased customers that became accustomed to the signature free of charge cookie after each order.

The world of additive manufacturing has widely been promoted as the embodiment of the future. 3D printers are the machines that are making this into a reality. Using metal as the raw material for printing has made 3D printing more than just a hobby. Airline juggernauts like Airbus and General Electric have been replacing traditionally made engine parts with lighter, 3D printed ones. This saves them millions in fuel costs. The major downside to all this has been the $1 million price tag. MatterFab, founded in 2013, came to the rescue with the goal of making metal-based additive manufacturing affordable.

## Why did MatterFab fail and shut down?

The Seattle based startup had a promising pitch and a noble cause - Making metal-based additive manufacturing an affordable reality. The company had stated that this is because of the experience of the team, which allows them to pull a dozen different engineering disciplines together and come up with workable solutions. MatterFab had initially shown serious promise, as their 3D printers were supposed to be about 10% of the price of a regular metal 3D printer.

MatterFab received $7.48M funding in February 2015. This was followed by $5.75M in May of that year, making the startup one of the most funded new enterprises in the 3D printing industry. Investors included GE and AutoDesk.

One cause for the failure of this once-promising startup can be stated in the words of Josh Ewing from AutoDesk - “We believed in MatterFab’s approach and vision, but unfortunately it didn’t succeed in the marketplace.”

Dave Warren, who is the co-founder and former CTO had left MatterFab in March 2016 to pursue a career with a Stealth Drone Startup. The other co-founder, Matt Burris had already left in October 2015. The reasoning from the investors' perspectives was that they needed a more experienced management team to lead the business. That team that followed them included Matt Paterson (the CTO brought in to replace Warren), but Patterson himself left MatterFab in March 2017.

A deeper problem besides this was the sad financial state of the company. With over $13 million raised since February 2015, the company appears to have burned through over half a million a month in 2016 alone!

Also, with GE purchasing established metal AM enterprises (like Concept Laser and Arcam) and their plans to launch the world’s largest metal 3D printer (ATLAS), their initial enthusiasm in investing in MatterFab may have evaporated before things could take-off successfully.

Navdy wanted to revolutionize automotive navigation through a heads-up display (HUD) model that projected the GPS navigation in front of you (much like in an airplane cockpit).

![Navdy](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/658decb17a397cda82d8f8d4_Navdy-min.webp)

The company's user-friendly device was meant to be installed on the dashboard of a car, right in front of the steering wheel and help make driving much safer by getting people to look straight ahead at the road rather than at their phones.

Navdy also came up with its own ios app that linked up with the main HUD device and provided it with the relevant navigational output to display to the driver.

Navdy’s pitch was quite straightforward. Whereas head-up displays are increasingly common in some cars (generally performance or luxury models), they’re still a relative rarity on mainstream vehicles, and there’s usually no retrofitting possible from the automakers themselves.

Their solution, therefore, was a device that mounted on the dashboard that included a small, transparent display panel within the driver’s line of sight that would project navigational information right in front of the driver.  

## Why did Navdy fail and shut down?

Navdy's HUD device was initially priced at $799, but they soon found out that demand was not going to keep pace with such a highly-priced gadget as predicted. The price was soon slashed down to $499 but instead of an influx of new demand, Navdy would learn the hard way that the HUD market was extremely saturated.

As previously states, the HUD display market is not something new and is quite common in high-end luxury cars. Navdy planned to create a new market for HUD navigational devices for the average user, but their price did not justify their stated goals.

More importantly, most users were complaining that Navdy’s HUD and its mobile app were not developed to satisfy customer needs appropriately. They argued that the display did not blend into the car’s windshield like some of its high-end competitors’ but that the device rather sat in front of the user’s line of view.

This meant that Navdy’s HUD display was in no way a better display compared to looking at a GPS or phone mount that can be purchased for much less. A lot of the customers also felt that the product was very slow in displaying the GPS navigation from its dedicated ios app.

However, more than the product itself, what would really bring down Navdy was their quest to create their own complete navigation system that would substitute Google Maps or other such service providers.

The costs for maintaining this service were not as cheap as they probably thought, and the price of maintaining such an expensive venture coupled with a lack of substantial demand for their product would prove to be the final nail in the coffin for Navdy. The company eventually went bust in 2018 due to these shortcomings.

## What was Pixate?

Pixate wanted to make prototyping and designing applications more accessible and effortless. Although the company was a small unit, it still had achieved a lot. Specifically, Pixate was a mobile app prototyping tool for Android and iOS that let users create and preview complicated interactions and animations. No use of code was needed to use the app that also helped improve the app design through interactive native prototypes.

## Why did Pixate fail and shut down?

Pixate became quite popular in a couple of years after its launch and was later acquired by Google in 2015. After purchasing Pixate, Google made Pixate Studio available for general users for free and made Pixate cloud service more affordable. In 2016 Google announced they would be shutting down Pixate so that the team could focus on a new product that would still be related to the prototyping field. They were referring to Google’s Material tools for developers and designers launched in October 2016.

RethinkDB was an open-source database, the first of its kind that makes use of a distributed and scalable NoSQL database. RethinkDB was built from its inception for real-time web applications. It provided solutions to make processes faster and more reliable such as using live push updates instead of the traditional and slower polling for data in queries.

## Why did RethinkDB fail and shut down?

RethinkDB founder highlighted in a postmortem some of the reasons for which he believed his company failed to thrive despite that fact that they had a good product.

Choosing the ‘wrong market’ was mentioned as one of their major mistakes. Since the beginning they were taken by their clients as being an open-source tool and pretty much no one wanted to pay for it. If a substantial price barrier would have been put, users would have probably searched for another tool in the ocean of free and open-source tools that other developers make available. Another major blunder was that despite they focused on seemingly important metrics, these weren’t the metrics users and clients were primarily interested in. Their ‘metrics of goodness’ according to the startup were releasing a flawless product (and yet their successful competitors at MongoDB became very popular even though they had an initial buggy product), design a simple interface, and database consistency. On the other hand, customers wanted the products to be available as soon as possible (they had to wait almost 3 years for RethinkDB), speedy performance, and a good and tried way to store JSON documents and create reports.

Fortunately, RethinkDB technology won’t fall into oblivion as it has been acquired a couple of months after its 2016 shutdown by the Linux Foundation (CNFC).

Secret was an Android and iOS app that allowed users to post content anonymously with their circle of friends or share it with a wider public. The app gained interest - and was at one point valued at 100 million- because it provided an outlet to those that didn’t want to be bound by the ‘real name’ rule of other social applications and face consequences for sharing their opinions and preferences. It also distinguished itself from other anonymous apps in that its interest factor for users could be higher since they knew that the person that shared a certain post on the app was someone that was in their contact list or circle of friends. The app became very addictive and some users said they routinely went through the motion of uninstalling the app only to install it again soon after that. The app was especially used in Silicon Valley.

## Why did Secret fail and shut down?

The number of active users of the app rapidly declined after only 18 months from its launch.

After the initial thrill and interest of the users, a more negative and unpleasant use of the app emerged. Users, under the cloak of anonymity, engaged in all forms of cyberbullying and harassment. Secret moderators stated they weren’t ready to deal with the flood of negative posts and inappropriate behavior.

As cyberbullying stories increased, so did the media news that covered such stories. A court ruling in Brazil even banned Secret from the country deeming it unconstitutional since although free speech was allowed, free speech (and the harassments that said speech could contain) should not be anonymous.

The app lost traction and was eventually suspended.

## What was Sidecar?

Sidecar was a transportation company based in united states (US). It was founded a couple of years after Uber but was never able to catch up with it despite the fact that it had a good product built on solid technology. One of the features Sidecar introduced was that of enabling riders to set their own price. In general, the app of the company offered much more control over their riding experience both for drivers and riders.

## Why did Sidecar fail and shut down?

Sidecar had top-notch technology but no marketing strategy. Car-hailing services depend on the traction present in the market and the network of drivers and passengers that they build. Sidecar could only become useful - and profitable - if there was always a high density of drivers and users. This is mainly where Sidecar failed. Unlike their giant competitors (Uber and Lyft) they didn't invest enough to market their product and gain customers. Uber reportedly lost almost a million in its first 6 months while it heavily focused on acquiring customers. Sidecar didn't have the backup funding to do that on a similar scale.

Also, instead of focusing on its powerful technology and the empowerment their app gave to its users, they tried to place themselves as an affordable alternative to Uber, which didn't really work for them. Weeks after shutting down on December 2015, though, they were acquired by GM.

Stayzilla was a successful homestay network in India and it raised $33.5 million in funding. Yogendra Vasupal, the founder, launched the company, under the name Inasra Technologies, in 2005.

He then changed the name to Stayzilla in 2010, because the owner wanted to expand his services in all the cities and Zillas (Districts) in India. The company was an early Airbnb business type that provided an online platform in which homestays, ‘alternative stays’, as well as hotels could be listed.

Stayzilla had over 15000 stays in about 1100 cities across the country and in 2013 it reached the 500 bookings in a day milestone.

## Why did Stayzilla fail and shut down?

Throughout its 12 years of operation, Stayzilla had to deal with a varied number of challenges.

The potential for a business like Stayzilla was huge, especially because they were among the first companies in India to venture into the sector and make use of technology.

However, being the first mover meant also that people were not very familiar with the concept, nor how to take advantage of the service and basically many didn’t even know how to use the internet. So Stayzilla’s first efforts and resources had to be directed towards both educating the market as well as essentially creating homestays.

As more competitors joined the market, various companies tried to differentiate themselves by offering frequent discounts. But Stayzilla’s operations costs were already too high and they were losing money every year.

The CEO also mentioned that they had also lost focus on the essential mission they had envisioned for the company.

The company has not been declared officially closed, though, as the CEO considers this a pause to regain clarity and plans to return on the scene with an improved service and a ‘clean slate’ soon.

Founded in 2003 by then 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, biotech upstart Theranos claimed to have devised a way to predict the onset of life-threatening diseases using just small amounts of blood samples—their revolutionary technology requiring only about 1/100 to 1/1,000 of the amount of blood that would ordinarily be needed for pre-existing tests. It then recommended preventative medical cures based on those results. Theranos was hailed as a revolutionary startup that raised more than $700 million in venture capital and private investor funding. At its peak around 2014, the company was valued at a whopping $10 billion.  

## Why did Theranos fail and shut down?

Elizabeth Holmes was a real sensation in the media, often featured on the covers of various business magazines and lists of top executives and innovators. On top of this, she was also honored with an interview with former US President Bill Clinton. During these media opportunities, Holmes stated that Theranos’ goal was to give people the power to have critical health information at the time it mattered and that she wanted to create a world in which no one ever had to say the phrase "if only I had known sooner." 

However, despite this ambitious goal, in October of 2015, when investigative reporter John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal questioned the validity of Theranos' technology, Holmes and her company started slipping into hotter and hotter water. The company soon found itself facing legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities and investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorney generals, former business partners, and former patients among other parties got involved in uncovering the fraud and by June of 2016, it was estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing following Holmes’ charging of wire fraud, among a list of other accusations. Soon after this, in September 2018, Theranos ceased operations. 

So what exactly happened here? Why did it take over a decade to expose this company? 

The story begins much earlier in 2002 when Elizabeth Holmes arrived at Stanford University with her breakthrough ideas. Holmes wanted to build a patch that would scan the wearer for infections and through its results, release the necessary antibiotics a patient needed. However, Dr. Phyllis Gardner, Holmes’ professor, tried to explain to her that the antibiotics Holmes wanted to use needed to be given at higher doses than a patch could deliver and that her idea would be difficult to implement. Undeterred, Holmes went on to drop out of Stanford University in 2003 at the age of 19 to start Theranos, then called Real-Time Cures under the disproven premise. As John Carreyrou points out in his thrilling non-fiction masterpiece, _Bad Blood_, Holmes had an unusual obsession with Steve Jobs that manifested in an obsessive copying of Job’s dressing style and making her employees read his books. Holmes had also infamously claimed that her device would soon be the “iPod of healthcare.” This “Apple complex” that Holmes possessed also led her to spy on her employees and demanded absolute loyalty from them.  

As Holmes’ scaled Theranos up and members of the team inevitably found out about the fabled, fraudulent technology, as the company scaled up operations, various early "disgruntled employees" were fired, threatened, and sued for trying to expose the reliability of the technology that Holmes claimed as revolutionary. The fraud was exposed when a former employee during the peak years of the company, Tyler Shultz, had attempted to bring concerns about the company's activities to his management, and when that had failed, he had spoken to Carreyrou and under an alias, reported the company to the New York State Department of Health. Despite ardent efforts by Holmes trying to get Rupert Murdoch to shut down the story that Carreyrou published on her, everything came crumbling downhill for what’s gone down as possibly one of the biggest frauds ever in the healthcare industry. 



## Opinion

Looking at the story of Holmes, the recipe for failure can be traced to back in 2002, when she failed to heed the advice of her professor while just a freshman at Stanford. This fostered success complex to chase dreams has destroyed young and seasoned entrepreneurs alke who look to get too successful too quickly. In an interview with CNBC, Patrick Hillman, a senior vice president at crisis-management firm Levick summarizes this effect, saying that startups are prone to big spending mistakes like any person put in the position of sudden wealth. “It’s the Hollywood syndrome,” Hillmann says, “they are stars and rich beyond their wildest dreams, and everyone is saying how brilliant they are. You need to stay grounded!” With the replication of business models becoming easier than ever, entrepreneurs today feel the need for excessive risk taking and constant innovation to protect market share at all costs. 

However, in the case of Theranos, there was another problem than just trying to obsessively recreate Apple’s success in a few years. Michael Sitrick, chairman and CEO of strategic communications firm Sitrick and Co., who has represented companies including ExxonMobil, Disney, and Hewlett-Packard during various crises, brilliantly states that “You can’t have sycophants who tell you that you’re the best-looking CEO in Silicon Valley. You need someone to tell the emperor they have no clothes on.” This is exactly what Theranos failed to do as a company. The thin skinned idealists heading the company could never take no for an answer and created a cult reminiscent of totalitarian regimes that wanted nothing but loyalty from its employees.

Tutorspree wanted to enhance the way tutoring is done by making it easier for students to find quality tutors in their area. Tutorspree graduated from Y Combinator in 2011 and was known as the "Airbnb for tutors". People could register as a student in their educational marketplace, set their preferences and filter so that Tutorspree algorithm could pair them up with the best available tutor for them among the 7000 tutors on the platform.

## Why did Tutorspree fail and shut down?

Tutorspree was a startup in a very seasoned and competitive sector. There is no clear-cut reason for the venture failure but analyzing some of the available information might help us shed light on possible culprits. First, it probably had to do with the founders of the company and their lack of expertise in the field. Also, Tutorspree's vision of pairing up tutors and students to meet up in person so as to create and maintain a real connection is commendable but not practical. Although indeed, in-person lessons are still very much valuable, the market -and the world- is heading on to a different direction.

It is also possible that the platform,which was initially taking 50% of the tutor’s fees, might have witnessed a decline in overall user growth because nothing could prevent tutors and students to schedule lessons without recurring to Tutorspree after they got to know each other.

Another problem for Tutorspree's seemed to be that the company was primarily dependent on search traffic from Google to acquire new students and tutors, and any algorithm changes could significantly reduce their traffic and in return their users.

As resources started to dwindle and funding failed to come in, Tutorspree decided to shut down. Its assets (including its user's database) were bought by Wyzant, a tutoring marketplace launched in 2005 which is still active.

Wattage was an online platform with an ambitious goal: break the entry barrier for hardware design. The ideal future Wattage envisioned was that of a world in which anyone could customize their electronics without needing to have any in-depth knowledge in the field. Anyone with an internet connection could start creating and customizing hardware by making use of the startup software. Once the user had all the specifications ready the product would be created with 3D printing, packed and shipped to the customer.

## Why did Wattage fail and shut down?

Wattage founder Jeremy Bell shared in a Medium post some of the reason he thinks the startup failed.

Among the first reasons he listed was the fact that they failed to gain traction and validate the existence of market interest for the product. In the early phase of development, their main focus was on demonstrating that the idea could technically be carried out and it was taken for granted that people would see it as a needed solution. Without any proof that people would actually adopt the service, it was difficult to convince investors to fund the project.  All sorts of doubts about viability and scalability started popping up and the team couldn’t provide definitive - or convincing enough - answers.

Wattage was on many points too much ahead of its time, and the full potential of their idea might have been overlooked by prospect investors and the target market. However, in a few years, as technological advances will render customization easier, Wattage (or another company) might re-introduce the concept and carry it out in a successful manner.

## What was dotCloud?

dotCloud was a platform as a service (PaaS) for developers that enabled them to host, assemble and run their applications on the service. Through dotCloud, numerous organizations found a safe and stable stage to maintain their organizations. dotCloud gave origin to the Docker project which became so successful that the company changed its name to Docker. As the potentials for Docker increased, the team decided to concentrate on it and sold off dotCloud to Berlin-based company CloudControl.

## Why did dotCloud fail and shut down?

dotCloud closed on February 29, 2016. The mother company, CloudControl, filed for bankruptcy and dotCloud, a very small part of the German organization, could not sustain operation costs by itself thus decided to stop its operations.

## What was Yik Yak?

Yik Yak was a proximity-based, anonymous social media app. People were able to make posts (Yaks), which were visible to other users in a 5-mile radius. Users could react to the posts by voting (up or down) or responding. Each user had Yakarma, which quantified the success of their posts, not unlike Reddit’s karma system.

Yik Yak enjoyed a lot of popularity especially in schools and college campuses throughout the US in 2013 and 2014. It became the 9th most downloaded social media app in the United States shortly after its launch in 2013 and reached 1.8 million downloads in September 2014.  

The app was created by [**Tyler Droll**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerdroll/) and [**Brooks Buffington**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooks-buffington-03a0178a/) who were college students at the time. The company they founded was initially funded by Atlanta Ventures and secured $1.5 million by other various investors. Once the app grew in popularity after its release, they were able to raise additional rounds of $10 million by the same investors and eventually $60 million by Sequoia Capital. At its peak, the business was valued between $350 and $400 million.

Yet, two years later Yik Yak was no more. On the 28th of April 2017, the company announced that it would be closing down in the coming week. But the story didn't end there. In a surprising turn of events, Yik Yak made a comeback, and most recently, it has been [**acquired by Sidechat**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/16/anonymous-app-sidechat-picks-up-rival-yik-yak-and-users-arent-happy/), its former rival.



## Why did Yik Yak Fail and Shut Down?

### Yik Yak’s Fall in Popularity

The technical reason Yik Yak shut down is quite straightforward. In 2016 Yik Yak shrunk 75% compared to 2015. It was never a self-sustaining business, and when their popularity started decreasing rapidly there was no reason for their investors to continue to fund the project. The company laid off 60% of its workforce and was eventually forced to shut down. It sold its intellectual property to Square for $1 million, equal to 0.25% of its peak valuation.

The interesting question is why Yik Yak shrunk in popularity so rapidly after it had shown an obvious product-market fit.



### Yik Yak’s Cyberbullying Problem

Cyberbullying proved to be an insurmountable problem for Yik Yak and it played a major role in the apps decline.

Just a few examples to paint a picture:

-   In 2014, a school in Massachusetts was forced to evacuate its students twice after receiving bomb threats on the app.
-   Two other schools were forced to evacuate under threats of violence on the app.
-   Matthew Mullen was arrested by the police in Michigan because of Yaks (posts) he had made threatening a school shooting.
-   Campus police at the University of Missouri [**arrested Hunter M. Park**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/11/university-of-missouri-police-arrest-suspect-in-social-media-death-threats/) because of threats of violence against black students he published on the app. He pleaded guilty to making a terrorist threat which resulted in a three-year suspended sentence combined with five years probation.
-   A student from Virginia Tech pleaded guilty of posting a threat on Yik Yak to repeat the 2007 campus shooting which took 32 lives.

These kinds of egregious offenses were more notable on Yik Yak compared to other social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook because of Yik Yak’s (presumed) anonymity. After all, you wouldn’t want to threaten a shooting with your name in plain sight.

That said, such heavy-duty offenses were somewhat rare nonetheless and you could argue that they would have taken place with or without the app. The real problem was the everyday bullying that took place on Yik Yak because it affected practically all of its users.

Jordan Seman, who had been repeatedly bullied on Yik Yak for her weight, posted an [**open letter about her problems**](https://middleburycampus.com/27709/opinion/a-letter-on-yik-yak-harassment/):  

> _“… when I scrolled through the message board and saw: “If I could bang a hippo for no finals, I would hunt down Jordan Seman.”  
>   
> My heart was pounding as I looked around the dining hall. A million things crossed my mind: Is someone watching me? Should I have worn this dress? Did someone see me eat that second cookie? Should I put on my jacket?  
>   
> In that moment, all of my insecurities flooded me. I felt exposed, betrayed and mostly embarrassed.”_

Cases like hers lead to a vocal out-cry in the media and several colleges and schools banning the app on their grounds. Two feminist groups and a few former students even filed a federal complaint form against the University of Mary Washington in Virginia for failing to protect them from cyber-harassment and threats of sexual violence on the app.

The story isn’t black and white, however. Some people claimed [**Yik Yak plaid a positive role**](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/yik-yak-online-anonymity-good-college-students/) on campuses and others argued that the media reaction about the cyberbullying taking place on the app was very overblown. A [**study at MIT Media Lab**](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/social-machines/overview/) compared it to Twitter and found that Yik Yak was less than 1% more likely to contain vulgar content.

All of that said, the hyper-localization of the app made cyberbullying on Yik Yak much more problematic compared to other social media platforms. If someone was bullying you on the app, you would know that they are near you in the real world. This means that even if the cyberbullying wasn’t more prevalent, it felt much more intense and threatening.

Jordan’s thought _“Is someone watching me?”_ when she read the Yak on campus wouldn’t have occurred if the message was on a non-localized platform like Twitter.

Consequently, the media outcry and outright bans aren’t that surprising.



### Digital fences: Yik Yak killing its own business

In response to the pressure from the media and various schools and colleges, Yik Yak implemented geo-fencing. It disabled its users from using the app while on the territory of most middle and high schools in the US.

This reaction, however, was suicidal for the business, because the app simply killed half of its biggest use-case. Anonymity and localization meant that the app was most useful for school and college students:

-   People who are concentrated in one place in large numbers
-   Belong to the same institution and have many things in common
-   Might want to remain anonymous when stating an opinion in public

With this in mind, it’s extremely predictable that the app would decline in popularity after it directly killed its biggest market. Moreover, negative growth is fatal for a money-burning venture-funded social media depending on virility.

In hindsight, Yik Yak geo-fencing schools to deal with its cyberbullying problems is equivalent to a person shooting himself in the stomach to deal with his intense stomach-ache.



### Failing to manage toxicity through moderation

Yik Yak’s problems aren’t foreign to all other social media platforms. Cyberbullying is, sadly, a common theme on the internet. The common way to deal with it is automatic or even better – manual moderation. For example, Reddit has volunteer moderators on most communities on the site (subreddits) that make sure hate-speech and bullying don’t take place within said communities. Facebook, on the other hand, has paid moderators going through all content flagged by users as inappropriate.

Yik Yak did try to implement some form of automatic self-moderation. A user posing sensitive content would receive the message:

_“Pump the brakes, this Yak may contain threatening language. Now it’s probably nothing and you’re probably an awesome person but just know that Yik Yak and law enforcement take threats seriously. So you tell us, is this Yak cool to post?”_

Yet, their efforts were obviously insufficient. A solution similar to that of Reddit might have done wonders for them. Moderation presents problems of its own – it risks becoming over-sensitive, removing any kind of controversial content even when it’s not damaging. That said, it’s far better than the alternative, especially bearing in mind Yik Yak was heavily affected by the cyberbullying problem because of their hyper-localization and young user base.



## Yik Yak Modern Day Alternatives

Despite Yik Yak’s demise, there’s still market need for an alternative. Currently, there are quite a few social media apps following in Yik Yak’s footsteps in terms of anonymity, hyper-localization, or both.

Below you’ll find 5 Yik Yak alternatives. The choice which one to use, however, would mostly depend on which app is most popular in your area/community.



### Yik Yak vs Jodel

You could call [**Jodel**](https://jodel.com/) the closest Yik Yak clone as it uses both anonymity and hyper-localization. It has gained popularity mainly on university campuses and has over 1.5 million active users. Jodel pays a lot more attention on moderation in a similar way to other modern social media (moderators flagging, reviewing, and deleting content) to battle the effects of the cyberbullying problems that plagued Yik Yak.



### Yik Yak vs Whisper

[**Whisper**](http://whisper.sh/) is the most popular app on this list – it boasts over 250 million monthly active users worldwide. That said, while it allows anonymous posting, it’s not hyper-localized and has a relatively different user-case as you wouldn’t interact exclusively with people in your school or college. It’s important to mention that Whisper doesn’t suffer from cyberbullying that much (because it’s not hyper-localized and it’s hard to target and bully a person directly and publicly), but plenty of people accuse the app of having too much toxicity and hateful content as a whole.



### Yik Yak vs Nearby

[**Nearby**](https://www.wnmlive.com/) is the opposite of Whisper – it focuses on hyper-localization instead of anonymity. Currently, it is mostly used to meet new people but explicitly declares that its goal is not dating, but rather finding new friends. This makes it more useful for people that move and travel a lot rather than for members of a local community like a school or college.



### Yik Yak vs Candid

[**Candid**](https://candidconnection.com/) is another Yik Yak alternative that allows anonymity and localization, yet puts less emphasis on the latter. You need to add (or find) your school/college/workplace on the app and you can participate in the discussions there. That said, Candid has wider functionalities and allows users to create groups and chats based on interests rather than location. To moderate and fight against cyberbullying, Candid uses mostly artificial intelligence tech solutions (i.e. modern automatic moderation, which admittedly is still not perfect by any means).



### Yik Yak vs After School

After School was a service very similar to Yik Yak that exclusively focused on high school students. The app, however, has been discontinued as of 2020. It faced very similar criticisms for enabling cyberbullying and apparently their inability to deal with the problem lead to their demise.



## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why Did Yik Yak Get Shut Down?

Yik Yak stopped operating in April 2017 due to a string of abuse and racial threats on college campuses. The company failed to manage moderation and increased digital security which ultimately made users lose interest and engagement in the platform.



### What Replaced Yik Yak?

Despite Yik Yak’s demise, there’s still market need for an alternative. Some replacements of Yik Yak include Jodel, Whisper, Nearby and Candid.



### What Was The Problem With Yik Yak?

Although YikYak had found product market fit, the company could not withstand the negative consequences that came from the bomb threats, sexual harassment cases, and discrimination from its users.



### Is YikYak Making a Comeback? 

Yik Yak sold their intellectual property to Square for $1 million. Since then Square decided to relaunch the app with some changes. The changes included new “community guardrails” to prohibit “bullying messages,” threats.
